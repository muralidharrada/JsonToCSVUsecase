# JsonToCSVUsecase

ETL program to read json data and perform transformations on it to produce CSV files as result.

Scope for further modifications:

Read Input path and output path dynamically by passing as arguments to the class.

Create a case class to read the input path and output path.

Create a jar file of the source and trigger it from a shell script from where we can pass the required parameters.

Load the result after transformation, directly to the database(Hive) and work on the tables.
